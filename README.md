# Bluetooth-Final

A simple Bluetooth Android app that obtains a socket from HC-05/06 module via RFcomm, and continues to listen for incoming bluetooth data. 
Incoming data will be shown/updated in the main UI inside a TextView.

It is assumed that the HC-05/06 bluetooth module is already paired before launching the app.
